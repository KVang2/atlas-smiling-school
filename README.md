## Implement a design with bootstrap
 - Implementing 3 different web pages with as much Bootstrap as possible. The goal is to match the figma page as much as possible.

 The 3 pages are 
 - Homepage homepage.html
 - Pricing pricing.html
 - Courses courses.html

A limited css page used to modify background color, text-color, and smaller detail that, I wasn't able to implement using bootstrap.
